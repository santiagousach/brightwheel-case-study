Web Scraping Exercise
This exercise will demonstrate your ability to create a functioning web scraping application that
will extract data into a structured format. The following website has preschool listings with
company, location and contact information available. Please create a functioning python
program that will:
1. Load the Website: https://txschools.gov/?view=schools&lng=en
2. Filter Grade levels to be included in the output:
a. Early Education
b. Prekindergarten
c. Kindergarten
3. 4. Click on every school link
Pull the following data from the link (data may be different, so pull whatever is available):
Company
Address1
Address2
City
State
Zip
Phone
Website
Grades Served
District
5. 6. Page through all search results
Export all data to a local csv file format.
What to include in the Readme:
●
How can this code be run?
●
What are the pros and cons for the python webscraping libraries you’ve decided to use?
●
Anything you may have included if you had more time. Examples might be:
○
Architecture
○
Orchestration
○
○
○
○
Data quality
Transformations
Other tools
etc.
What will we be looking for:
1. Can I run this program without issues?
2. Is all of the data captured successfully?
3. Is the code clear and easy to read?
4. Is part of this code reusable to scrape other websites? (this will be more related to
reusable constructs/classes)
a. Here is an example of another website we would like to be able to reuse at least
some of the code to gather necessary information:
